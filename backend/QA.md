# Quality Assurance (QA)

- __Quality Assurance (QA)__ - Focused on the overall system, processes, documentation, prevention, and oversight:

- __ProductSpecification & MaterialSpecification:__ These are QA-controlled documents defining product and material quality standards.

- __BatchFormula:__ The master recipe, a QA-controlled document.

- __ProcessGroupTemplate & ProcessTemplate:__ These represent master batch records or Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), which are fundamental to QA. They define how processes should be run.

- __Document & DocumentApproval:__ Critical for managing all controlled documents (SOPs, specifications, test methods, policies) and their approval workflows, a core QA function.

- __Deviation:__ Essential for recording any out-of-specification results or process deviations. Managing deviations, investigating root causes, and implementing corrective/preventive actions is a key QA responsibility.

- __User & UserGroup:__ Managing roles, responsibilities, and access control is part of QA.

Approval steps like User? ApprovedBy in ProcessGroupGroup (for batch record approval/release) are QA oversight functions.

__The hierarchical structure__ (Product -> ProcessGroupGroup -> ProcessGroup -> Process) itself, when based on approved templates, ensures manufacturing adheres to QA-defined procedures.

__LabelValue:__ Can be used by QA to enforce specific data collection or tracking requirements not covered by fixed fields.
