# Quality Control (QC)

__Quality Control (QC)__ - Focused on testing, inspection, and operational checks:

- __ProductSpecification:__ Defines the standards against which the final product is tested (a QC input).

- __MaterialSpecification:__ Defines the standards for incoming materials (a QC input).

- __QualityParameter:__ Defines the specific tests to be performed.

- __QualityCheck:__ Records the execution and results of these tests on materials or in-process samples. This is a core QC activity.

- __EnvironmentalParameter:__ Defines environmental conditions to be monitored.

- __EnvironmentalMonitoring:__ Records the actual environmental readings, a key QC check.

- __ProcessParameter:__ Defines critical parameters for manufacturing operations.

- __ProcessParameterValue:__ Records the actual values of these parameters during a process, serving as an in-process control (IPC) check.

- __MaterialUsage:__ Can have associated QualityChecks, implying QC checks on dispensed or used materials.
Verification steps like User? VerifiedBy in ProcessGroup and Process also represent QC checks.
