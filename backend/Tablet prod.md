# Tablet Production

The production of a pharmaceutical tablet is a multi-stage process, starting from meticulous planning and raw material sourcing, through manufacturing, and finally to quality control and release. Here's how your services would support these stages:

## __Phase 1: Planning, Definition & Setup__

- __Product & Specification Definition:__

    - __Goal:__ Define the new tablet product, its characteristics, and quality specifications.
    - __Services Used:__
        - __IProductsService:__ To create and manage the Product entity (e.g., "Paracetamol 500mg Tablet").
        - __IProductSpecificationsService:__ To define the detailed ProductSpecification for the tablet (e.g., active ingredient content, dissolution rate, hardness).
        - __IBatchFormulasService:__ To define the BatchFormula or recipe, detailing the quantities of each material per batch size.

- __Raw Material Management:__

    - Goal: Identify, qualify, and manage suppliers and raw materials.
    - __IMaterialsService:__ To define each Material (e.g., Paracetamol API, Microcrystalline Cellulose,    Magnesium Stearate).
    - __IMaterialGroupsService:__ To categorize materials (e.g., Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, Excipients).
    - __IMaterialSpecificationService:__ To define specifications for each raw material.
    - __ISuppliersService:__ To manage Supplier information for raw materials.
    - __IUnitsService:__ To define units of measure (e.g., kg, g, L) for materials.

- __Process Design & Templating (SOPs):__

    - __Goal:__ Define the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for each manufacturing step and phase.
    - __IProcessTemplatesService:__ To create ProcessTemplate entities for individual operations (e.g., "Sieving API," "Blending Step 1," "Tablet Compression"). These templates would include instructions, required materials (MaterialTemplate), parameters to monitor (ProcessParameter), machines, user groups, and whether verification or environmental monitoring is needed.
    - __IProcessGroupTemplatesService:__ To create ProcessGroupTemplate entities, which represent manufacturing phases (e.g., "Granulation Phase," "Compression Phase," "Coating Phase"). A ProcessGroupTemplate would consist of a sequence of ProcessTemplates and define overall phase requirements like required tests, environmental parameters, and documents.
    - __IRoomsService:__ To define Room entities where processes will occur, specifying their characteristics.
    - __IMachinesService:__ To define Machine entities used in the processes.
    - __IUserGroupsService:__ To define UserGroup entities (e.g., "Production Operators," "QA Verifiers") authorized to perform or verify steps.
    - __IDocumentsService:__ To manage SOP documents, which can be linked as RequiredDocuments in ProcessGroupTemplate.

## __Phase 2: Production Order & Material Staging__

- __Production Order (Batch) Creation:__

    - __Goal:__ Create a ProductionGoal: Initiate a specific manufacturing batch for the tablet.
    - __IProcessGroupGroupsService:__ To create a ProcessGroupGroup (representing the batch or production order). This entity links to the Product, BatchFormula, specifies batch size, planned dates, and will track the overall status of the batch.

- __Material Request & Dispensing:__

    - __Goal:__ Request and dispense the necessary raw materials for the batch.
    - __IMaterialRequestsService:__ To create a MaterialRequest for the batch, detailing the MaterialRequestItems needed based on the BatchFormula.
    - __IInventoriesService:__ To track Inventory levels. When materials are dispensed, an inventory transaction (subtraction) is recorded.
    - __IQualityChecksService:__ Potentially used here to record pre-dispensing checks on materials against their MaterialSpecification.

## __Phase 3: Manufacturing Execution__

This phase involves executing the defined ProcessGroups (e.g., Granulation, Blending, Compression, Coating) for the batch. Each ProcessGroup is an instance derived from a ProcessGroupTemplate.

- __Process Group Execution:__
    - __Goal:__ Execute a manufacturing phase (e.g., Granulation).
    - __IProcessGroupsService:__
        - To create an instance of a ProcessGroup for the current batch (ProcessGroupGroup) based on its ProcessGroupTemplate.
        - To update the status of the ProcessGroup as it progresses.
    - Within each ProcessGroup, individual Process instances are executed based on their ProcessTemplate.
    - __IProcessesService:__
        - To update the status of each Process (e.g., "Started," "In Progress," "Completed," "Verified").
        - To record MaterialUsage (actual materials consumed, batch numbers, quantities, linked to User who performed the action). This would trigger updates via IInventoriesService.
        - To record ProcessParameterValues (e.g., blender speed, compression force, temperature) by a User.
        - To link Machines used and Users/UserGroups involved.
        - To manage PerformedBy and VerifiedBy users for each Process.

    - __IEnvironmentalMonitoringService:__ If a ProcessTemplate (Process.Template.RequiresEnvironmentalMonitoring) indicates the need, this service records environmental readings (EnvironmentalMonitoring) for the Room where the Process is taking place.
        - If readings are out of limits, the IProcessesService (or a dedicated deviations service) might be used to create an EnvironmentalDeviation.
    - __IQualityChecksService:__ To record in-process quality checks (QualityCheck) performed during various Process steps (e.g., blend uniformity, tablet weight variation).
    - __IDocumentsService:__ To manage and link batch manufacturing records (BMRs) or electronic batch records (EBRs) associated with the ProcessGroup and individual Processes.
    - __ILabelValuesService:__ To record any specific label values or identifiers generated or used during the process.

## __Phase 4: Quality Control & Finishing__

- __Final Product Testing:__

    - __Goal:__ Test the finished tablets against specifications.
    - __IQualityChecksService:__ To record results of final QualityChecks on the finished batch (e.g., assay, dissolution, content uniformity) against the ProductSpecification.
    - __IProductSpecificationsService:__ Referenced to compare test results.

- __Packaging & Labeling (could be another ProcessGroup):__

    - __Goal:__ Package the tablets and apply final labels.
    - This could be managed as another ProcessGroup using IProcessGroupsService and IProcessesService.
    - ILabelsService & ILabelValuesService: To manage and apply final product Labels with relevant -  - LabelValues (e.g., batch number, expiry date).
    - IInventoriesService: To record the addition of finished goods to Inventory.

## __Phase 5: Batch Release & Archival__

- __Batch Review & Release:__

    - __Goal:__ Review all batch documentation and quality results to approve the batch for release.
    - __IProcessGroupGroupsService:__ To update the status of the ProcessGroupGroup (batch) to "Released" or "Rejected" after review by authorized personnel (e.g., QA). This might involve an ApprovedBy user and ApprovedDate.
    - __IDocumentsService:__ To ensure all relevant documents (BMR, QC results, deviation reports) are complete and approved.
        - IDocumentsService (potentially with GetDocumentApprovals and HasRequiredApprovals if approval workflows are built into it).
    - __Documentation Archival:__

        - __IDocumentsService:__ To archive all records related to the batch.

__Ongoing & Supporting Services (Used throughout the lifecycle):__ 
    - __IUsersService:__ Manages user accounts, roles, and permissions. Crucial for identifying who performed, verified, or approved actions at every step. Used by almost all controllers for authorization.
    - __IICompaniesService:__ Manages company information, ensuring data is scoped correctly. Used by almost all services to associate data with a specific company.
    - __ITrainingRecordService:__ To ensure personnel are adequately trained for the tasks they perform (e.g., operating specific Machines, executing ProcessTemplates, understanding SOP Documents). Records are linked to Users and trainable items.
    - __IChangeRequestService:__ To manage any changes to Products, Materials, ProcessTemplates, Documents, etc. This ensures controlled modifications to the manufacturing process.
    - __IAuditService:__ To conduct internal or external audits of the manufacturing processes, quality systems, or supplier qualifications. AuditFindings might lead to CAPAs.
    - __ICapaService:__ To manage Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA) arising from deviations (Deviation, EnvironmentalDeviation), audit findings, or complaints. CAPAs can be linked to AuditFindings.
    - __IINotificationsService:__ To send Notifications to relevant Users or UserGroups about critical events, deviations, pending approvals, task assignments, or status changes in processes or documents.
