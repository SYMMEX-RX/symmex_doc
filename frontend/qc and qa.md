- ## V.Key Front-End Considerations:

  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The UI must dynamically show/hide elements and enable/disable actions based on the logged-in user's UserType and UserGroup memberships.
  - Responsiveness: Ensure usability across different devices if required.
  - User Experience (UX): Intuitive navigation, clear forms, helpful error messages.
  - State Management: Choose a suitable state management library (e.g., NgRx) for complex data flows.
  - API Integration: Efficiently call the backend APIs and handle responses (loading states, errors).
  - Notifications: A dedicated area or toast messages to display Notifications from the backend.
  - Search and Filtering: Implement robust client-side or server-side assisted search/filtering for all list views.

This list provides a comprehensive starting point for the front-end development needed to support your pharmaceutical QC system. Each item would translate into specific components, pages, and user flows
